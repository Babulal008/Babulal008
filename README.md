📚 About Me

🚀 I specialize in Blockchain Development, crafting decentralized apps (dApps), writing smart contracts, and integrating Web3 technologies with modern frontend frameworks.

💼 I work across Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC, using tools like Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle, Web3.js, and Ethers.js to bring blockchain ideas to life.

🛠️ From smart contract development to full-stack dApp integration, I bridge the gap between blockchain protocols and user-friendly interfaces.
